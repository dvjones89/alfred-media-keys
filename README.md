# Alfred Media Keys
I recently purchased a 1989 Apple Extended Keyboard (M3501).

I love this keyboard, but one thing really urked me; the loss of the media control keys for altering volume, skipping tracks, play, pause, etc.

As it turns out, my clever friend [@caius](http://www.twitter.com/caius) had already solved this problem using AppleScripts triggered by a handy app called [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/). His repo can be found [here](https://github.com/caius/special_keys)

Already a huge fan of Alfred, and keen to avoid another dependency on my machine, I've created an Alfred Workflow that binds the F7-F12 keys to appropriate AppleScripts. No FastScripts required.

This should work with any PC keyboard, as well as Vintage apple hardware, to retrofit the media control keys.

# Requirements:
* Alfred (and it's PowerPack)

# Installation
Simply download the [Alfred-Media-Keys.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/dvjones89/alfred-media-keys/raw/master/Alfred-Media-Keys.alfredworkflow) and open the file. Alfred should import it automatically.
